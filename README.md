# Dotfiles

This repository is for holding my configuration files and sharing them across
all of my sessions. You are welcome to scrape it in the search for useful
commands.

## Vim

Regarding vim I use the following packages:
- *'vim-plug'*: plugin management
- *'gruvbox'*: vim theme
- *'pathogen'*: extra plugin management, somewhat more intuitive since it
  requires only that we clone from GitHub to ~/.vim/bundle

## Bashrc

Basic setup for GitHub and custom prompt.

## VsCode

Random gibberish because I don't understand VsCode configurations.
